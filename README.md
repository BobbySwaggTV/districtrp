# DistrictRP

## About
This is the DistrictRP collection of FiveM server files open sourced. All files included are open source and belong to their respective authors. Files are either originally already open source or self developed. Since the server has closed down, please feel free to use the code to improve your own server or spin another one out of it. 

## Setting up
To setup a server from these files, clone the entire `resources` folder and you can either use the sql structure dump or use the SQL setup scripts in each individual esx resource folder. 

## Support
No support will be provided nor will this be updated ever again. This is mostly just a dump of the server files for anyone to make use of.
