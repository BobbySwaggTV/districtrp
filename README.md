# DistrictRP

## About
This is the DistrictRP collection of FiveM server files open sourced. All files included are open sourced and belong to their respective authors. Files are either originally already open source or self developed and improvised. Since the server has closed down, I would like to share these files instead of letting it rot in a corner of the storage. Please feel free to use the code to improve your own server or spin another one out of it. 

## Setting up
To setup a server from these files, clone the entire `resources` folder and you can either use the sql structure dump or use the SQL setup scripts in each individual esx resource folder. 

## Support
No support will be provided nor will this be updated ever again. **Feel free to star it to show some support**.
